/**
 * Priority rules engine for internet connectivity state.
 *
 * The engine resolves a connectivity state top-down:
 *
 *   1. Manual override (forced by REST / Web UI). `offline` is absolute;
 *      any other override is reachability-gated so it can't claim a
 *      connection that isn't there.
 *   2. Hardware instant-down (a mapping resolving to `offline`)
 *   3. Reachability base (hardware "up" mapping -> verify probe, else
 *      active probing fallback)
 *   4. Contextual heuristics refine the resolved base
 *
 * Heuristics are **modifiers**, not verdicts: they refine a base state
 * that has first been established by reachability. A heuristic can only
 * make the state more severe (down the ladder
 * `online < metered < captive < offline`), never better, so "metered"
 * is never reported when there is in fact no internet. The classic case is
 * a watch schedule: `online` (Starlink reachable) + on-watch -> `metered`,
 * while on-watch with the dish down stays `offline`. The same principle
 * gates a manual `online`/`metered`/`captive` override: forcing metered
 * means "metered if reachable, else offline."
 *
 * Hardware and heuristic rules feed off the live Signal K delta stream
 * cache maintained by the plugin; the evaluator exposes a `set` method to
 * push cached path values into it. When a hardware rule flips its uplink
 * to "down" the engine transitions to offline with zero delay; when it
 * flips to "up" the engine requests a single targeted probe to confirm
 * actual routing before publishing online.
